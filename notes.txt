The keyword struct introduces a structure declaration which is a list of declarations enclosed in 
braces.

struct {  } a, b, c
    is analogous to `int a, b, c'.
a consequence of this meaning is that
struct { } a[4]
    declares an array of 4 of the structure.


struct [struct tag] {  } [instances];
    where struct tag is an identifier that allows later instances to be declared using the {  } syntax.
    e.g.  ``struct point = {1,2}'' after a ``struct point {int x; int y; 

functions can return structs.

The size of a pointer which will be used as an array has its range set by initialization with brace syntax.
automatic variable - 
static
    static functions are constrained to the file they are defined in.
    static variables do not get de-allocated after a function stops executing.
extern
    makes a variable declared within a non-global scope a global variable.

All enum identifiers are global.
